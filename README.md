# Multiclass-NLP-Tutorial
Demonstration I made showing many different machine learning algorithms for tackling a multiclass classification NLP problem.  

I uploaded this repo is more for my own reference and not necessarly to demonstrate to others how to approach a multiclass classification problem involving text. I taylored this notebook towards helping my capstone group learn how to handle classification problems similar to what we will be tacking.
